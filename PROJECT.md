# ProductPipeline — PROJECT.md

> **Last updated: 2026-02-23. Any agent working on this project MUST update this file before finishing.**

## 1. Project Overview

**ProductPipeline** (formerly "ebay-sync-app" / "Product Bridge") is a full-featured listing automation platform for **Pictureline's UsedCameraGear.com** store. It replaces Marketplace Connect (Codisto) for Shopify ↔ eBay integration.

**What it does:**
- Watches a StyleShoots network drive for new product photos → auto-uploads to Shopify
- Generates AI product descriptions via OpenAI GPT
- Processes product images (background removal, templates) via self-hosted service or PhotoRoom API
- Syncs products, inventory, prices, and orders between Shopify and eBay
- Provides a web dashboard for review, approval, and management
- Integrates TradeInManager condition data into listings
- Draft/staging system with review queue before publishing

**Business context:** Pictureline photographs used camera gear on a StyleShoots machine. Products flow from Lightspeed POS → Shopify → need AI descriptions + processed photos → eBay listings. This app automates that entire pipeline.

**eBay seller:** usedcam-0 (https://www.ebay.com/usr/usedcam-0)
**Shopify store:** usedcameragear.myshopify.com

### Known Issues

- CORS still references old Railway domain (`ebay-sync-app-production.up.railway.app`)
- Logs page disabled (`.tsx.bak`)
- GitHub repo not yet renamed from original name

## 4. Key Integrations

### Shopify API
- **Client:** `@shopify/shopify-api` (GraphQL + REST)
- **Store:** usedcameragear.myshopify.com
- **Auth:** OAuth flow via `/auth/shopify` routes, tokens stored in DB
- **Operations:** Products CRUD, image upload, order creation, inventory management, metafields
- **Webhooks:** Product create/update/delete at `/webhooks/shopify`

### eBay API
- **Auth:** OAuth2 with token auto-refresh (`token-manager.ts`)
- **APIs used:** Fulfillment (orders), Inventory (items + offers), Browse (search), Trading (account/policies)
- **Seller:** usedcam-0
- **Webhooks:** Platform notifications at `/webhooks/ebay`

### Image Processing
- **Primary:** Self-hosted FastAPI service (`image-service/`) — background removal, processing, templates
  - URL configurable via `IMAGE_SERVICE_URL` (default: `http://localhost:8100`)
  - Docker-based, concurrency-controlled
- **Fallback:** PhotoRoom API (requires `PHOTOROOM_API_KEY`)
- **Selection:** `IMAGE_PROCESSOR` env var: `self-hosted` | `photoroom` | `auto` (default)
- **Factory:** `image-service-factory.ts` handles provider selection with health checks

### StyleShoots Drive
- **Watch path:** `/Volumes/StyleShootsDrive/UsedCameraGear/`
- **Flow:** Folder appears → stabilize 30s → parse folder name → fuzzy match Shopify product → upload images
- **Preset folders** map to product categories (e.g. "Trade-Ins - Small Lenses")
- **SMB mount** with reconnect handling

### TradeInManager (TIM)
- **URL:** https://trades.pictureline.com
- **Auth:** Session-based login (mrfrankbot@gmail.com, password in `~/.clawdbot/credentials/tradeinmanager.txt`)
- **Data:** Condition grades, grader notes, serial numbers, pricing
- **Matching:** SKU-based matching between TIM items and Shopify products
- **Auto-tagging:** Applies condition tags to Shopify products

### OpenAI
- **Purpose:** Generate product descriptions, suggest eBay categories
- **Model:** GPT (via `openai` npm package)
- **Context:** Includes product title, vendor, TIM condition data, product notes

- Domain: `ebay-sync-app-production.up.railway.app` (needs rename)
- SQLite DB persists on Railway volume

## 6. How to Continue

### Local Dev Setup

```bash
cd ~/projects/product-pipeline
npm install

# Start dev server (auto-reloads)
npm run dev          # Server at http://localhost:3000

# Or run server + web separately:
npm run dev:server   # Express API
npm run dev:web      # Vite dev server (HMR)

# For image processing, also start the image service:
cd image-service
docker compose up    # or: python server.py
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
npm run cli -- status              # Dashboard
npm run cli -- orders sync         # Sync eBay orders
npm run cli -- products sync       # Sync products to eBay
npm run cli -- inventory sync      # Sync inventory
```

### Deploy

```bash
# Railway auto-deploys from git push
git push origin main

# Manual: Railway CLI
railway up
```

### Adding New Features

1. Add API route in `src/server/routes/`
2. Register capability in `src/server/capabilities.ts` (auto-surfaces in chat + UI)
3. Add frontend page in `src/web/pages/`, route in `App.tsx`
4. Add nav item in `AppNavigation.tsx`
5. Update DB schema in `src/db/schema.ts` if needed

### Testing

```bash
npm test              # vitest run
npm run test:watch    # vitest watch mode
```

Test files: `src/services/__tests__/`

## 7. Decision Log

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **SQLite over Postgres** | Single-user app, Railway volume support, zero-config, fast |
| **Drizzle ORM** | Type-safe, lightweight, great SQLite support |
| **Express 5** | Familiar, async route support, serves both API + static frontend |
| **Factory pattern for images** | Self-hosted service saves PhotoRoom API costs; factory enables seamless fallback |
| **File-based credentials** | Predates env vars; supports both now (env overrides files) |
| **Draft/staging system** | Chris wanted to review AI descriptions before publishing to Shopify |
| **Capability registry** | Chat widget and UI auto-discover features; no manual prompt maintenance |
| **Chokidar watcher** | Reliable cross-platform file watching with debounce/stabilization |
| **Rename from "ebay-sync-app"** | Scope grew far beyond eBay sync; now a full product pipeline |
| **TIM integration** | Condition data from trade-ins improves AI description quality |

## 8. Next Steps

**Prioritized remaining work:**

1. **Rename Railway domain** — Still using `ebay-sync-app-production.up.railway.app`
2. **Rename GitHub repo** — Match new ProductPipeline name
3. **Re-enable Logs page** — Currently `.tsx.bak`, needs fix
4. **eBay listing creation** — Full automated Shopify → eBay listing push (partially implemented in `listing-manager.ts`)
5. **Image service deployment** — Deploy self-hosted image service to Railway alongside main app
6. **Auto-pipeline trigger** — Automatically run pipeline when StyleShoots watcher detects + uploads photos
7. **Batch operations** — Process multiple products through pipeline at once
8. **eBay category mapping improvements** — Better auto-suggestion, more category coverage
9. **Webhook reliability** — Retry/queue for failed Shopify/eBay webhooks
10. **Auth hardening** — Current API key auth is basic; consider proper session auth for web UI

## Recent Changes

### 2026-02-23: Approve Draft → Create eBay Listing Flow

Built the end-to-end "list on eBay" workflow from the draft review queue:

**Backend:**
- New service: `src/services/ebay-draft-lister.ts` — single-product eBay lister
  - Builds eBay inventory item from draft content (title, description, images) with Shopify fallback
  - Ensures Pictureline inventory location exists (idempotent)
  - Fetches business policies, maps condition/category/aspects using existing mappers
  - Creates eBay inventory item → offer → publishes → saves `product_mappings` record
  - Updates `product_drafts.status` to `'listed'`, saves `ebay_listing_id` + `ebay_offer_id`
  - Logs success/failure to `sync_log`
  - Dry-run preview mode: builds full payload without calling eBay publish
- Two new API routes in `src/server/routes/drafts.ts`:
  - `POST /api/drafts/:id/list-on-ebay` — creates live eBay listing (single product, explicit click only)
  - `POST /api/drafts/:id/preview-ebay-listing` — dry run preview of what would be sent to eBay
- DB schema: added `ebay_listing_id` and `ebay_offer_id` columns to `product_drafts` table (auto-migrated on startup)

**Frontend (`ReviewDetail.tsx`):**
- "🛍️ Approve & List on eBay" button in the Actions sidebar card
- Confirmation modal with safety warning before listing goes live
- "Preview Listing" option loads dry-run payload inline in the modal
- Shows live eBay listing badge + "View on eBay" link after success
- Pipeline Status card updated with eBay listing step (green when listed)
- `statusBadge()` handles new `'listed'` status

**Safety:** NO batch, NO auto-publish. Single product, explicit user action required.

### 2026-02-18: Product Detail Page Redesign
Redesigned `ShopifyProductDetail` in `src/web/pages/ShopifyProducts.tsx` to match ReviewDetail quality:
- **Single CTA**: "Run Pipeline" appears only in page header (removed from Quick Actions and sidebar)
- **Removed Quick Actions card**: External links moved to page `secondaryActions`
- **Status badges in title**: TIM Condition and eBay status shown as compact badges next to product title
- **Pipeline as sidebar hero**: Pipeline progress tracker is now the top sidebar card
- **Beautiful empty states**: Photos section shows a dashed drop-zone with Drive search CTA when empty
- **Conditional cards**: TIM Condition and eBay cards only render when data exists (no empty cards)
- **Consolidated Details card**: Merged product info into a single compact card, tags shown inline
- **Subtle animations**: Fade-in animation on page load
- **Consistent spacing**: `gap="400"` throughout, matching ReviewDetail patterns
- **All functionality preserved**: No features removed, only visual reorganization
